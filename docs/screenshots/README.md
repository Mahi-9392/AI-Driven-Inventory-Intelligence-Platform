# Screenshots Directory

This folder is for storing screenshots and demo images of your application.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take screenshots** of your application:
   - Dashboard view
   - Forecast generation page
   - Inventory management page
   - Login/Signup pages
   - PDF reports
   - Any other important features

2. **Save images** in this directory with descriptive names:
   - `dashboard.png`
   - `forecast-page.png`
   - `inventory-page.png`
   - `login-page.png`
   - `pdf-report.png`

3. **Recommended image specifications:**
   - **Format**: PNG or JPG
   - **Size**: 1200x800px or similar (16:9 aspect ratio works well)
   - **File size**: Keep under 1MB for faster loading on GitHub

4. **Update the main README.md** to include your screenshots:
   ```markdown
   ### Dashboard View
   ![Dashboard](./docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
   
   ### Forecast Generation
   ![Forecasts](./docs/screenshots/forecast-page.png)
   ```

## Tips for Good Screenshots

- Use a clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar, extensions)
- Include the full viewport, don't crop too tightly
- Use consistent window sizes for all screenshots
- Consider using tools like [Shots.so](https://shots.so) or [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) for professional-looking screenshots
- Add annotations or arrows to highlight key features if needed
